* lineInfo: saved lines show
* deletions of saved lines (with confirmation)
* when searching line from stopInfo -> check DB first

* after lookup of stop ID from line stops list - update stops list
* find tool on toolbar (small redesign), remove search button from header
* add confirmation on delete all stops action

* stop tossing lineShape to current table, push only lineIdLong

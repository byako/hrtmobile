general:
* fill this TODO DONE section with data from git log
* use WorkerScript to provide threading in lineInfo, stopInfo, settings, realtimeSchedule,  mainPage (route - loading done)
* finish networking config in settings and lineInfo - make possible to search online using dialog to ask
* fix showLine map action in context of stopInfo
* koolah
* pinch anction on map
* ленивая загрузка
* use NetworkInfo API to check if online\offline http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtmobility-1.2/qml-networkinfo.html
* use landmarks from Location API on route page
* check if the page is in stack before pushing so we can prevent loops
* fix models names and views names
* split all data into favorites and just DB

lineInfo: 
* move lines parsing to worker script
* add networking config support
* add possibility to search online even when offline data found
* add confirmation on delete all lines action
* remove exceeding fields in lineInfoModel
* after lookup of stop ID from line stops list - update stops list
* make sure after search lines\stops list has currentIndex of new stop, it will be used in route/map page: after moving index show line info
* add checkboxes to multiselectiong dialog lines
* add settings "group same line with diff directions)

stopInfo:
* add networking config support
* add confirmation on delete all stops action
* save schedule in DB
* show nearest available stops based on GPS data
* split depart schedule to hours
* merge same stops, show all line types in drop down or so

settings:
* add networking mode variants:
 - full offline
 - full online
 - info offline\schedule online

realtime:
* schedule countdown timer visualize

* ADD FUCKING PROGRESS INDICATOR. 16 lines parsing takes too long
* consider not push to DB all found stops\lines but only which user marks as favourit
* worker script for route loads lineshape much faster
* improve speed of line shape creation
* move config object to separate qml file
* merge same line in one, show both directions in drop down or so
